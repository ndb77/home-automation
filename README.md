- Web-based dashboard interface
- Mobile app support
- Voice control integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher (for web interface)
- Smart home devices (compatible with your chosen protocols)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation.git
cd home-automation
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Node.js dependencies (if using web interface):
```bash
npm install
```

4. Configure your devices and settings in `config.yaml`

5. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file with your device configurations:

```yaml
devices:
  - name: "Living Room Light"
    type: "smart_switch"
    protocol: "wifi"
    ip_address: "192.168.1.100"
  
  - name: "Thermostat"
    type: "thermostat"
    protocol: "zigbee"
    device_id: "thermostat_001"

automation:
  - name: "Good Morning"
    trigger: "time"
    time: "07:00"
    actions:
      - device: "Living Room Light"
        action: "turn_on"
      - device: "Thermostat"
        action: "set_temperature"
        value: 72
```
